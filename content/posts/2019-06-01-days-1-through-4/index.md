## What I have accomplished so far...Days 1-4

I started coding over four years ago when I began working for an auto finance company. I started working at the company full-time my senior year of
college to help pay my tuition. Initially, the company hired me as a file/data entry clerk, but it was a fairly new company and there was a lot of room for
growth. I eventually landed a dual role as a document management team leader and data/reporting analyst. As a new company our day-to-day processes needed to be created, documented, and continually optimized. I began coding by learning VBA to make fast, accurate, and efficient excel reports. I turned a process that took the company approximately 28-30 days to complete, into a process that only took a couple of hours. This was magic to me! I immediately began spending my free time learning to code with online resources like codeacademy, freecodecamp, edx, skillcrush, and egghead. I also recently attended a coding boot camp which allows it's Almumnae to continually use their program to learn as tech continues to constantly change.  I have worked on solo freelance projects, and I am open to joining a remote team .
 As one of my efforts to become a better developer I decided to commit to the code for 100 days challenge. I will document my journey on this site .
 So far I am on day 4/100 . I will follow-up with more detailed posts. Links to my portfolio are under construction ðŸ˜„ .
